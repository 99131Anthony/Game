	 <h1>Definition of Game</h1>
	  <p> The officla definition from <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/game">dictionary.com</a> say:
		  As a noun, an amusement or pastime <br>
		  As an adjective, the word "game" becomes: gam·er, gam·est. 
		  pertaining to or composed of animals hunted or taken as game or to their flesh. <br>
		  As a verb (without an object), the word "game" becomes: gamed, gam·ing.
		  to play games of chance for stakes; gamble. <br>
		  My definition of game is: an activity to reach an objective(s) or make your own objective(s). 
		  most of these activites have a set of rules or you can make your own rules.
