	<h1>üëã About Me</h1>
  	 <p> 
	Hello, my name is Anthony Graham. I'm a senior at ESUMS
	(Engineering and Science University Magnet School). I'm 17 years old and
	I want to major in electrical engineering and computer science. My hobbies consist
	of cooking, learning math, and playing games.

	 <h1>Definition of Game</h1>
	  <p> The officla definition from <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/game">dictionary.com</a> say:
		  As a noun, an amusement or pastime <br>
		  As an adjective, the word "game" becomes: gam¬∑er, gam¬∑est. 
		  pertaining to or composed of animals hunted or taken as game or to their flesh. <br>
		  As a verb (without an object), the word "game" becomes: gamed, gam¬∑ing.
		  to play games of chance for stakes; gamble. <br>
		  My definition of game is: an activity to reach an objective(s) or make your own objective(s). 
		  most of these activites have a set of rules or you can make your own rules.
	  </p>  
		  
	  <h1>Type of Gamer</h1>
	    <p> I am 87% Explorer

			What Bartle says:

			Explorers delight in having the game expose its internal machinations to them. 
			They try progressively esoteric actions in wild, out-of-the- way places, looking for interesting features (ie. bugs) and figuring out how things work. 
		   	Scoring points may be necessary to enter some next phase of exploration, but it's tedious, and anyone with half a brain can do it. 
		   	Killing is quicker, and might be a constructive exercise in its own right, but it causes too much hassle in the long run if the deceased return to seek retribution. 
		   	Socialising can be informative as a source of new ideas to try out, but most of what people say is irrelevant or old hat. 
		   	The real fun comes only from discovery, and making the most complete set of maps in existence.

			You are also:

			49% Killer

			40% Socialiser

			27% Achiever

	<h1>Favorite Games</h1>
	  <p>My favorites games so far have been Monopoly, Pok√©mon, and Yu-Gi_Oh!</P>
	
	    	<h2>Monopoly</h2>
		<p>Monopoly is an eternal game that can take hours. 
		 Trading, maganing properties, and trying to get the most money is what makes Monopoly fun to me.
		 Unfortnately there not to much people to play with and also I don't have much time to play either.
		</p>

	    	<h2>Pokemon</h2>
		<p>Pok√©mon has branched off into many different games as of now. T
		   here was the main line games which focuses on the different generations and regions of Pok√©mon you can encountered.
		   <br>
		   Some side games like Pokk√©n Tournament‚Ñ¢ DX which is a fighting game featuring a variety of Pok√©mon you can can to fight with.
		   The format is 1 v 1 fighting in a different 3D-platform stages.
		   <br>
		   Pok√©mon Unite is a MOBA game where teams of 5 fighting against each other killing wild Pok√©mon 
		   on the field for exp to level up and gain point to score onto the enemy's goal zones.
		   Work with the team to secure objectives that can help you later on in team fights.
		   Which ever team scores the most points win.
		</p>	
	
		<h2>Yu-Gi-Oh!</h2>
		<p>Yu-Gi-Oh! is a card game with many different mechicans that I can't even begin to explain.
		   If you want to learn more Yu-Gi-Oh! then go to this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">website.</a> 
		   It's a fun game if you undertsnad all all of the rules so I suggest you take the time to at least learn the basic.
