	<h1>👋 About Me</h1>
  	 <p> 
	Hello, my name is Anthony Graham. I'm a senior at ESUMS
	(Engineering and Science University Magnet School). I'm 17 years old and
	I want to major in electrical engineering and computer science. My hobbies consist
	of cooking, learning math, and playing games.

	 <h1>Definition of Game</h1>
	  <p> The officla definition from <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/game">dictionary.com</a> say:
		  As a noun, an amusement or pastime <br>
		  As an adjective, the word "game" becomes: gam·er, gam·est. 
		  pertaining to or composed of animals hunted or taken as game or to their flesh. <br>
		  As a verb (without an object), the word "game" becomes: gamed, gam·ing.
		  to play games of chance for stakes; gamble. <br>
		  My definition of game is: an activity to reach an objective(s) or make your own objective(s). 
		  most of these activites have a set of rules or you can make your own rules.

	  <h1>Type of Gamer</h1>
	   <p> I am 87% Explorer

			What Bartle says:

			Explorers delight in having the game expose its internal machinations to them. 
			They try progressively esoteric actions in wild, out-of-the- way places, looking for interesting features (ie. bugs) and figuring out how things work. 
		   	Scoring points may be necessary to enter some next phase of exploration, but it's tedious, and anyone with half a brain can do it. 
		   	Killing is quicker, and might be a constructive exercise in its own right, but it causes too much hassle in the long run if the deceased return to seek retribution. 
		   	Socialising can be informative as a source of new ideas to try out, but most of what people say is irrelevant or old hat. 
		   	The real fun comes only from discovery, and making the most complete set of maps in existence.
