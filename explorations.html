  <p>Me and my group worked on a board game together that involves dices and blockers. 
     The game can be played with 2 to 4 players. The goal is to get your piece to the center space.
     You use one dice to determine how much spaces you move. The pieces start on the outside circle
     three spaces apart from each other. At the start of the game you can two blockers which can be
     placed anywhere, in order to use it you need to roll a one. If you decide to place a blcok then
     you can't move for that turn. When you are clsoe to the center space you need an exact roll to 
     win.</p>
       
  
  <p>I made a sprite that moved across the screen to the right and
      would go back to the left side of the screen, all of this in a loop.
