  <p>Me and my group worked on a board game together that involves dices and blockers. 
     The game can be played with 2 to 4 players. The goal is to get your piece to the center space.
     You use one dice to determine how much spaces you move.</p>
       
  
  <p>I made a sprite that moved across the screen to the right and
      would go back to the left side of the screen, all of this in a loop.
